/* Context information flags.  Most of these flags are context-type-specific,
   and are only used with some context types:

	CONTEXT_KEY_SET: The key has been initialised.

	CONTEXT_IV_SET: The IV has been set.

	CONTEXT_ISPUBLICKEY: The key is a public or private key.
	CONTEXT_ISPRIVATEKEY:

	CONTEXT_DUMMY: The context is a dummy context with actions handled 
			through an external crypto device.  When a device context is
			created, it usually isn't instantiated at the device level until 
			the key (and possibly other parameters) are available because
			most devices use an atomic created-initialised-context operation
			rather than allowing incremental parameter setting like cryptlib
			does.  To handle this, we first create a dummy context and then
			fill in the details on demand.

	CONTEXT_DUMMY_INITED: The dummy context has been initialised.  Since
			the context isn't instantiated until required, this flag is 
			needed to keep track of whether any cached parameters retained 
			from the dummy state need to be set when the context is used.

	CONTEXT_EPHEMERAL: The context is ephemeral rather than a long-term
			context backed by a keyset or crypto device.

	CONTEXT_SIDECHANNELPROTECTION: The context has side-channel protection
			(additional checking for crypto operations, blinding, and so
			on) enabled.

	CONTEXT_HASH_INITED: The hash parameters have been inited.

	CONTEXT_HASH_DONE: The hash operation is complete, no further hashing
			can be done 

	CONTEXT_ASYNC_ABORT: Asynchronous operation state management flags
	CONTEXT_ASYNC_DONE: */
